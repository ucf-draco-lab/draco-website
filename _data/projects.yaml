- title: Blocks of Code (v3)
  subtitle: Physical block programming.
  image: images/projects/block-o-code.png
  link: #
  description: Create a block that based on orientation and manipulations performs one of several fundamental operations. When blocks are placed together they form more complex actions. Blocks should be ultra low-power and cost under five dollar per unit. End product should contain at least 25 blocks. See results from V1 completed by [PDX Senior Capstone team circa 2015](https://github.com/erebus-labs/blocks-o-code) and V2 completed by [UCF 2024 team]().

  subtitle: Unmask the secrets of data collection and logging
  image: images/projects/sense.png
  link: #
  description: Create a data collection platform that allows for basic environmental data collection for at least three different properties (e.g., temperature, weight/pressure, brightness). Trading off sensor accuracy for simplicity is critical. Platform should allow end user to input the model that converts raw data measurements into known units. See results from V1 completed by [PDX Senior Capstone team circa 2015](https://github.com/erebus-labs/sense_platform) and V2 completed by [UCF 2024 team]().

- title: 3D Projection Title
  description: Develop a 2^n x 2^n Grid of RGBW+ LEDs that is fed from the simulation output of a cycle/turn-based multi-agent simulator. Enable connectable components to increase the grid-size. Basic version should feature fixed 3D printed topology with each unit square being illuminated via an RGB+ led - stretch goal should feature pneumatically controlled tube structures and a flexible membrane.

- title: Dizzy Quadcopter
  description: Develop a micro-drone (<250g) with main-body continuously spinning at specific RPM; drone must still be fully controllable in XYZ. Preference toward hardware (PID) control system approach to spin correction. Spinning main body must be able to hold distance sensor.Telemetry and sensor data should be reported back to base controller.

- title: Secure, Heterogeneous, Autonomous, and Rotational Knowledge for Swarms
  subtitle: SHARKS
  image: images/projects/sharks.png
  description: This research project focuses on developing drones in a given swarm with limited compute resources and little memory, so developing efficient behaviors is necessary for the agents to work within these restrictions. In addition to positioning behaviors, this project investigates safety protocols to protect the swarm from adversarial swarms and environmental obstacles.
