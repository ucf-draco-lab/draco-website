# DRACO


{% include section.html %}

Welcome to the Design of Resilient Architectures for Computing (DRACO) lab website. We're a part of the [Electrical and Computer Engineering Department](http://ece.ucf.edu) at the [University of Central Florida](http://ucf.edu) located in spectacular Orlando, Florida.

## Highlights

{% capture text %}

We develop algorithms and processes to design, develop, and assess the resilience, robustness, security electronic devices and systems.
All of our research and nearly all of our (~100) publications and presentations involve students.

We work on a broad range of projects, funded by various federal and industry partners, while much of our work is open source, some of our work may remain embargoed or partially-redacted when necessary.

We have opportunities for undergraduate (paid or experiential based on interest and time commitment) and graduate research (funded). Our research projects are tightly coupled with the topics listed above, but we also sponsor more applied projects which may be of interest to Senior Design Teams.
