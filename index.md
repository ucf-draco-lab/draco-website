# DRACO


{% include section.html %}

The DRACO Lab, a part of the [Electrical and Computer Engineering Department](http://ece.ucf.edu) at the [University of Central Florida](http://ucf.edu) explores secure and resilient computing at the intersection of hardware, embedded systems, and artificial intelligence. We design methods to protect against side-channel attacks, hardware Trojans, and malicious logic, while also creating open-source tools and hands-on platforms that prepare the next generation of engineers and educators.

## Highlights

{% capture text %}

We develop algorithms and processes to design, develop, and assess the resilience, robustness, security electronic devices and systems.
All of our research and nearly all of our (~100) publications and presentations involve students.

We work on a broad range of projects, funded by various federal and industry partners, while much of our work is open source, some of our work may remain embargoed or partially-redacted when necessary.

We have opportunities for undergraduate (paid or experiential based on interest and time commitment) and graduate research (funded). Our research projects are tightly coupled with the topics listed above, but we also sponsor more applied projects which may be of interest to Senior Design Teams.
