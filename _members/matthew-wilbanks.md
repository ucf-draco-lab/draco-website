Matthew Wilbanks is an undergraduate Electrical Engineering student at the University of Central Florida with a strong interest in hardware-focused design and hands-on engineering. He enjoys bringing concepts from the classroom into practical builds, simulations, and prototypes. He is especially drawn to how real-world electronics are designed, tested, and improved, from component-level analysis to system-level integration. Outside of his academic work he enjoys fishing, watching anime, and gaming with friends.
