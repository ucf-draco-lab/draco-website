Jarred Long (CpE BS '24) is a current master's student at UCF. He is currently working on the design and implementation of an encrypted ALU using polymorphic principles. Specifically, a dynamic key that changes at certain intervals. This approach aims increase the security of the system while minimizing the impact on latency compared to fully homomorphic encryption schemes. After his masterâ€™s degree Jarred hopes to find work in the digital design industry; possibly while pursuing a PhD.
