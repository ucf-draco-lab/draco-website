Joshua is an undergraduate computer engineering student at the University of Central Florida. He is part of UCF's Northrop Grumman Scholars Program and has interned for their superconducting digital electronics team for the past two summers. His push into research started when he interned at Sandia National Laboratories at the Technology Transfer Office, which inspired him to pursue research that would create a positive impact. His research interests are in computer architecture with a focus on hardware trojans and side channel attacks. Outside of research, he is involved in UCF's Student Chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery and trying new things with friends and family.
