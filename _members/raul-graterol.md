Raul Graterol is a dedicated computer engineering student at the University of Central Florida, with career aspirations closely tied to the fields of computer architecture, artificial intelligence, high-performance computing, and VLSI circuits and systems. From a young age, Raul has been captivated by the complexities of computing systems, driving him to pursue a degree in computer engineering. His academic journey includes earning the UCF Electrical Engineering Department Awards for inaugural Northrop Grumman undergraduate scholars.

Raul's research experience includes his role in developing CASCADE, a Simulation-Based Framework for Design Space Exploration of CNN FPGA-based Accelerators. This project deepened his understanding of VLSI design principles and sparked his interest in creating energy-efficient computing solutions, a critical aspect of contemporary computer architecture.

In the summer of 2022, he worked as a Data Scientist Intern at Planet Home Lending, where he focused on improving the performance of algorithms for real-time data processing. This role allowed him to apply his theoretical knowledge to practical challenges, refine his coding skills, and appreciate the importance of high-performance computing in artificial intelligence.
