Cory Brynds is a Computer Engineering Master's student at the University of Central Florida, where he also earned his BS in Computer Engineering in May 2025. He is a recipient of the AMD Graduate Research Fellowship. As part of the DRACO and UNARY labs, Cory's research lies at the intersection of mathematics and hardware design, applying function approximation and other techniques to create faster, smaller, and more power-efficient hardware operators. Passionate about knowledge sharing, he is collaborating with AMD and UCF's ECE department to develop new coursework in arithmetic hardware design.

Cory has interned at AMD the past two summers, working in the GPU Architecture division to optimize arithmetic hardware. As an undergraduate researcher in the UNARY Lab, he explored techniques to accelerate Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) and built a profiling framework for FHE applications.

Outside of academics, Cory stays active through weightlifting and badminton, spends too much on Legos, and enjoys traveling. He always welcomes new travel suggestions.
