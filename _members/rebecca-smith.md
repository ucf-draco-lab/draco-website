Rebecca Smith is a freshman pursuing her Bachelor's of Science in Electrical Engineering with Honors at the University of Central Florida. She is actively involved in Knights Racing Formula SAE, IEEE, and Women in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. She is also competing in the Sumobots competition hosted by the Robotics Club of Central Florida with her roommates. Rebecca previously gained experience from her internship at Efabless during the summer of 2024, where she emulated the Caravel ASIC chip on the Arty A7-100T FPGA board and tested how much dedicated ML hardware accelerators improved the performance of a tic-tac-toe ML program. She is eager to contribute to the DRACO lab through the SHARKS project and learn more about autonomous swarms.
